        <h2>How we select petitions</h2>
        <p>
            We select recommended petitions based on three key criteria, each with sub-questions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> What scale of positive change can this petition create?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much benefit is gained by a change from the current state to the suggested state?</li>
                    <li>Do Key Stakeholders have influence over other important issues?</li>
                    <li>How important is the general issue discussed by the petition?</li>    
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Tractability:</strong> How possible is it to achieve the desired outcome?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>How likely is the petition to reach 'critical numbers' both with and without sharing? (either for media attention, formal action, or org legitimacy). Are these number practically possible to achieve?
                    <li>Do Key Stakeholders have the power to fix the issue?</li>
                    <li>Is there surrounding work being done, so that getting the attention of Key Stakeholders turns into them taking action?</li>
                    <li>How easy is the petition to read, understand and act upon?</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Neglectedness:</strong> How under-addressed or overlooked is this issue?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>How likely is the petition to reach 'critical numbers' both with and without sharing? (either for media attention, formal action, or org legitimacy). Are these numbers challenging to achieve?</li>
                    <li>How not-well-understood is the general issue discussed by the petition?</li>
                </ul>
